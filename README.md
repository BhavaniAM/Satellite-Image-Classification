# Satellite Image Classification

This repository explains the method of Image Classification on satellite images to classify/group them using Convolutional Neural Networks into 4 different classes: Barren land, Forest, Grassland and Other (a class that consists of all land cover classes other than the previous three).

The dataset used is DeepSat4, which is taken from the [DeepSat](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/deepsat-sat4) notebook on Kaggle.
